# Description: It combines input, lists, loops, conditionals, and simple logic for a practical grading tool.



# Calculating Grades (ok, let me think about this one)

# Write a program that will average 3 numeric exam grades, return an average test score, a corresponding letter grade, and a message stating whether the student is passing.

# Average	Grade
# 90+	A
# 80-89	B
# 70-79	C
# 60-69	D
# 0-59	F

# Exams: 89, 90, 90
# Average: 90
# Grade: A
# Student is passing.

# Exams: 50, 51, 0
# Average: 33
# Grade: F
# Student iis failing.

    letter_grade = "A"
elif avg >= 80 and avg < 90:
    letter_grade = "B"
elif avg > 69 and avg < 80:
    letter_grade = "C"
elif avg <= 69 and avg >= 65:
    letter_grade = "D"

for grade in grades:
    print("Exam: " + str(grade))
